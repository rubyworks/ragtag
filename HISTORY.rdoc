= RELEASE HISTORY

== 0.6.0 | 2010-10-15

RTALS has been renamed to RagTag!

Along with the name change, RagTag no longer uses namespaces to separate
attribute names.

== 0.5.0 // 2010-04-19

This is the first public release of RTALS. The library is
finally at a point where I think it is generally usable.
While it still has much room for improvement, all the
essentially functionality is in place.
