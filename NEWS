= Release Notes

== 0.1.1 // 2008-08-30

This is the initial release of RTALS. But, it is
released only for the sake of (hopefully) perking
the interestss of others. The current implementation
is merely a demonstration; and would require 
significant improvements to make it of value in 
production. That being said, I believe this working
prototype demonsrates quite well why this kind of
template system would make an excellent choice, should
someone tak the time to make a solid library of it.

As you may have guessed this project is up for adoption.
