== OVERVIEW

RTALS stands for Ruby Tag Attribute Lanaguage System. Yea, it's an
acronym. Don't blame me, blame those Zope people ;)

RTALS is not fully compatiable with the Zope TAL sepcification.
It's first priority is to provide a good attribute based
template system for Ruby. But beyond that it does try to support
as much of the Zope spec as it can.


== USAGE
